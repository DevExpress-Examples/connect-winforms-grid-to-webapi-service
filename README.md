# Connect the WinForms Data Grid to a Secure Backend with the DevExpress Web API Service (EF Core with OData)

The following example demonstrates the following:

1.	How to build a data model for application business entities and security policies with EF Core.
2.	How to securely load data from OData endpoints to a WinForms UI client using the [DevExpress WinForms Data Grid](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/controls/winforms/grid/) control.
3.	How to activate authentication and authorization for the WinForms application using custom Web API endpoints (powered by the [DevExpress Backend Web API Service](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/403394/backend-web-api-service)).
4.	How to create a login form and customize its user interface elements based on access permissions.

## Getting Started

1.	Open *WebApiExampleAll.sln*. [Register a DevExpress NuGet feed](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/116698/nuget/setup-visual-studios-nuget-package-manager) in the Visual Studio IDE. Skip this step if you have already registered the DevExpress NuGet feed.
2.	Restore NuGet packages in the solution:

3.	Run the **OData.Server** project. Right-click OData.Server in the Solution Explorer and select **Debug** | **Start New Instance** in the menu. Your default web browser will open. Starting the Web API server for the first time can take up to 20 seconds.
    
    > **IMPORTANT**
    > 
    > Do not close the web browser.
4.	Run the **WinForms.Client** project. Right-click OData.Server in the Solution Explorer and select **Debug** | **Start New Instance** in the menu.
5.	Click "Log in" to proceed. The password for **Admin** and **User** accounts is "QQQ". You can sort, filter, and group grid rows (records) as needed. Double-click a grid row to open the edit form and modify cell values:
